            <p>
                Have you ever noticed that little yellow text near the right hand side of the Minecraft Logo on the title screen, and                     just ignored it? Well this project will solve that! This is a Texture (also called Recource) pack that will not only                     change the text for that, you can add your own as well! Each week I will chose around 5 - 10 phrases suggested for it and                 add it to the pack! To suggest, all you have to do is join the Discord (⬆) and chat your suggestions in the suggestions                   channel! There is no limit to the amount of text you can suggest, and it will be fun to see what gets added!
            </p>

                At this time, I have not released a compleated build of this pack! Check the Discord (⬆) for updates and to test the                     pack!
